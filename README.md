# Tweeter

This project is created with the template as such
```
npx react-native init --template react-native-template-typscript
```

It explores the use of: 
- FlatList
- React Navigation
- React Native Gesture Handler
- Flipper & Async Storage
- Base Native Component Library
- Fakerjs library

This app is created for some of my [exercise submissions for Centauri React Cohort](https://github.com/lyqht/centauri-react-native).
