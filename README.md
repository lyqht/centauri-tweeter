## Exercise 1: Characters Remaining

### Task

> Source of instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/Centauri-React-Native-Cohort/blob/main/react-native/action-items/2022-01/2022-01-04.md). 

Create a simple textbox that displays how many characters are remaining in the "tweet" to send out (Tweets are 280 characters).

If the characters remaining are equal or more than 10, make the info text light gray. If the characters remaining are less than 10, make it Yellow. If you exceed the character limit, make the details Red.

### Lessons Learnt
- This was pretty simple to do since I had React knowledge.
- I find it interesting how the TextInput component still keeps the bold formatting that I copied elsewhere ðŸ˜ƒ

## Exercise 2: Navigation

### Task

> Source of instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/Centauri-React-Native-Cohort/blob/main/react-native/action-items/2022-01/2022-01-13.md).

Implement a simple 2-screen app, where you have button "Go to details screen", clicking which takes you to the "details" screen and hitting "back" takes you back to the first screen.

### Lessons Learnt

Some extra things I tried and learnt about:
- Local storage using [React Native Async Storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage). The `useAsyncStorage` hook is really easy to use.
- [Flipper](https://github.com/facebook/flipper) for debugging and [Flipper Advanced Async Storage Plugin](https://github.com/lbaldy/flipper-plugin-async-storage-advanced) for CRUD actions on local storage.
- State management using React context still works as intended on React Native.
